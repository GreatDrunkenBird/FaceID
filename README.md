# FaceID

A simple python code to identify persons by their face,
utilizing the face-recognition (https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/) library
most basics functions in conjunction of open-cv for image processing and
tkinter for GUI.

Train folder used to store the images the face-recognition library uses as base to identification process,
also, image files names use the format "Person Name_n" (n = number) for there can not be more than one file with
the same name and extension.
Test folder not mandatory, only a way to better organize the project.
